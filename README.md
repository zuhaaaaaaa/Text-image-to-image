# Text-image-to-image
To run the code, you will need to have Python and the required libraries installed, including PyTorch, Diffusers, Gradio,and PIL.

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running  `!pip install torch torchvision`.
2. I had to use colab for my code running (replace with the appropriate setup script for your environment python).
3. Run the code `text/image-to-image` to start the click to below
4. In the Gradio interface, enter a text prompt in the "Enter your prompt here" field to generate the image.
5. Optionally, upload a source image for image-to-image generation.
6. Click the "Submit" button to generate the image and view the BLEU score.

Please note that generating high-quality images may require significant computational resources, especially when using GPUs. Make sure your system meets the necessary requirements for running the Stable Diffusion model efficiently.
